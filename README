survival record scripts

The purpose of these scripts is to record information of left4dead survival games so that statistics can be run on them. The information is kept on four files: records.txt, players.txt, groups.txt, and maps.txt. These files should not be edited manually but can be edited through the python scripts.

main script file: survival_records.py
